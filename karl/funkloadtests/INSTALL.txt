To use funkload tests, you need to have funkload installed.
But after install, there is a problem with one of its dependencies, webunit.

Webunit does not correctly check the domain when you are running against a website that uses a port as part of its address.

So, we fixed this. 
I included the cookie.py which replaces cookie.py that is installed with funkload & webunit. 

Here is the long explanation of the problem and fix:
So funkload can login to karl website with 

self.setBasicAuth("admin","admin")

once the initial "cookie" problem is fixed.

The cookie error we initially get is: 
Error: COOKIE ERROR: Cookie domain ".localhost:6543" doesn't match request host "localhost"

I've installed funkload in my own directory (not in svn) to test
I identified the error in cookie.py which is located in my test directory's:
lib/python2.5/site-packages/webunit-1.3.8-py2.5.egg/webunit/

In cookie.py's decodeCookies method, (near line 70) the orginal said:

if not server.endswith(domain):
                raise Error, 'Cookie domain "%s" doesn\'t match '\
                    'request host "%s"'%(domain, server)

I wanted to test a locally run server for the developers which is running on a 6543 port so the cookie always failed. 

I changed that part of method to:
            port = 6543
...

            full_serveraddress = '%s:%s' % (server, port)
            if not (domain.endswith(server) or domain.endswith(full_serveraddress)):
            #if not server.endswith(domain):
                raise Error, 'Cookie domain "%s" doesn\'t match '\
                    'request host "%s"'%(domain, server)

and now I don't get cookie error and I can use the basicauth to login to karl and "do stuff." 

I e-mailed an FYI to webunit and funkload creators, but aren't expecting any response.
